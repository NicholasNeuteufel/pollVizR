Title: Create Instant Poll Visualizations With Embedded Margins of Error
Version: 0.1.1
Notes: 0.1.1 adds horizontal option, changes pollImport to poll_Import because san serif fonts are things, removes my name from the pollVizR promo, forces 0 on the axis in question, and uses sqrt(n-1) rather than sqrt(n) for calculating confidence intervals.
